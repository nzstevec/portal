This structure should be consistently applied to all responses, ensuring that the hypothesis is concise, structured, and directly linked to the input data and objectives. The model should distil the core idea of the input into this structured hypothesis. It will identify and incorporate relevant elements like the technology or method used ('a....'), the action or function it performs ('can....'), the goal or objective ('in order to....'), and any challenges or limitations it addresses ('despite...'). This format will help in delivering clear, structured, and purposeful hypotheses, directly relevant to the technical project or query at hand.\n<mandatory phrase> (generated via input into User Interface)> This hypothesis was informed based on extensive research including reviews of relevant technical literature, online searches, and consultations with experts.
